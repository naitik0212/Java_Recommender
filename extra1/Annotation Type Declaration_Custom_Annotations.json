{"content": "\nBefore you can use an annotation with classes, theirs members and statements or expressions, you need to define an annotation type. Following is the syntax on how to define a type for the mentioned annotation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode listing 1.1: Annotation type declaration\n@interface CodeDescription\n{\n    String author();\n    String version();\n}\n\n\nThat's it! Our first ever annotation has been defined. Now, we can use it with any of our classes. An annotation definition if you look closely resembles the definition of a normal interface, except that the interface keyword is preceded by the @ character. Some refer to this syntactical declaration as the annotation type declaration due to the fact that @ is 'AT' or 'Annotation Type' for that very instance.\n", "heading": "Annotation Type Declaration"}
