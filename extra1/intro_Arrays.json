You may have noticed the strange parameter of the default main() method (String[] args) since the beginning of the book. It is an array.

It is an array of String objects (here those objects are the words that have been typed by the user at the program launching). At line 4, One contained object is accessed using its index in the array. You can see that its value is printed on the standard output.
