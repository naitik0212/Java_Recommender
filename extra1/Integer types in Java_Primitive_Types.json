{"content": "\nWith what we have learned so far, we will identify the different types of signed integer values that can be created and manipulated in Java. Following is a table of the most basic numeric types: integers. As we have discussed earlier, the data types in Java for integers caters to both positive and negative values and hence are signed numeric types. The size in bits for a numeric type determines what its minimum and maximum value would be. If in doubt, one can always calculate these values.\n\nLets see how this new found knowledge of the basic integer types in Java fits into the picture. Say, you want to numerically manipulate the days in a year \u2014 all 365 days. What type would you use? Since the data type byte only goes up to 127, would you risk giving it a value greater than its allowed maximum. Such decisions might save you from dreaded errors that might occur out of the programmed code. A much more sensible choice for such a numeric operation might be a short. Oh, why couldn't they make just one data type to hold all kinds of numbers? Wouldn't you ask that question? Well, let's explore why.\n\nWhen you tell a program you need to use an integer, say even a byte, the Java program allocates a space in the memory. It allocates whole 8 bits of memory. Where it wouldn't seem to matter for today's memory modules that have place for almost a dozen trillion such bits, it matters in other cases. Once allocated that part of the memory gets used and can only be claimed back after the operation is finished. Consider a complicated Java program where the only data type you'd be using would be long integers. What happens when there's no space for more memory allocation jobs? Ever heard of the Stack Overflow errors. That's exactly what happens \u2014 your memory gets completely used up and fast. So, choose your data types with extreme caution.\n\nEnough talk, let's see how you can create a numeric type. A numeric type begins with the type's name (short, int, etc.) and then provides with a name for the allocated space in the memory. Following is how it's done. Say, we need to create a variable to hold the number of days in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode section 3.54: Days in a year.\n1 short daysInYear = 365;\n\n\nHere, daysInYear is the name of the variable that holds 365 as its value, while short is the data type for that particular value. Other uses of integer data types in Java might see you write code such as this given below:\n\n\n\n\n\nCode section 3.55: Integer data types in Java.\n1 byte maxByte = 127;\n2 short maxShort = 32767;\n3 int maxInt = 2147483647;\n4 long maxLong = 9223372036854775807L;\n\n", "heading": "Integer types in Java"}
