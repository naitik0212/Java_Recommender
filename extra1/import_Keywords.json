{"content": "\nimport is a Java keyword. \n\nIt declares a Java class to use in the code below the import statement.  Once a Java class is declared, then the class name can be used in the code without specifying the package the class belongs to.  \n\nUse the '*' character to declare all the classes belonging to the package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport package.JavaClass;\nimport package.*;\n\n\n\nThe static import construct allows unqualified access to static members without inheriting from the type containing the static members:\n\n   import static java.lang.Math.PI;\n\nOnce the static members have been imported, they may be used without qualification:\n\n   double r = cos(PI * theta);\n\nCaveat: use static import very sparingly to avoid polluting the program's namespace!\n\nJava Programming/Packages", "heading": "import"}
