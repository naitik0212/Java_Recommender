{"content": "\nConsider the following code:\n\n\n\n\n\nCode section 3.43: Ungrouped declarations.\n1 int a;\n2 int b;\n3 String c;\n4 a = 10;\n5 b = 20;\n6 c = \"some text\";\n\n\nThere are various ways by which you can streamline the writing of this code. You can group the declarations of similar data types in one statement, for instance:\n\n\n\n\n\nCode section 3.44: Grouped declarations.\n1 int a, b;\n2 String c;\n3 a = 10;\n4 b = 20;\n5 c = \"some text\";\n\n\nAlternatively, you can further reduce the syntax by doing group declarations and assignments together, as such:\n\n\n\n\n\nCode section 3.45: Grouped declarations and assignments.\n1 int a = 10, b = 20;\n2 String c = \"some text\";\n\n", "heading": "Grouping variable declarations and assignment operations"}
