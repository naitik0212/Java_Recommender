{"content": "\nassert is a Java keyword used\nto define an assert statement.\nAn assert statement is used to declare an expected boolean condition in a program.\nIf the program is running with assertions enabled, then the condition\nis checked at runtime. If the condition is false, the Java runtime system\nthrows an AssertionError.\n\nAssertions may be declared using the following syntax:\n\n\n\n\n\nassert expression1 [: expression2];\n\n\nexpression1 is a boolean that will throw the assertion if it is false.  When it is thrown, the assertion error exception is created with the parameter expression2 (if applicable). \n\n\n\n\n\nassert list != null && list.size() > 0 : \"list variable is null or empty\";\nObject value = list.get(0);\n\n\nAssertions are usually used as a debugging aid.  They should not be used instead of validating arguments to public methods, or in place of a more precise runtime error exception. \n\nAssertions are enabled with the Java -ea or -enableassertions\nruntime option. See your Java environment documentation for additional options\nfor controlling assertions.\n", "heading": "assert"}
