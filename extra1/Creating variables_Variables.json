{"content": "\n A graphical representation of computer memory\nVariables and all the information they store are kept in the computer's memory for access. Think of a computer's memory as a table of data \u2014 where each cell corresponds to a variable.\n\nUpon creating a variable, we basically create a new address space and give it a unique name. Java goes one step further and lets you define what you can place within the variable \u2014 in Java parlance you call this a data type. So, you essentially have to do two things in order to create a variable:\n\nCreate a variable by giving it a unique name; and,\nDefine a data type for the variable.\nThe following code demonstrates how a simple variable can be created. This process is known as variable declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode section 3.40: A simple variable declaration.\n1 int a;\n\n", "heading": "Creating variables"}
