{"content": "\nAlthough memory spaces have their own addresses \u2014 usually a hash number such as 0xCAD3, etc. \u2014 it is much easier to remember a variable's location in the memory if we can give it a recognizable name. Identifiers are the names we give to our variables. You can name your variable anything like aVariable, someVariable, age, someonesImportantData, etcetera. But notice: none of the names we described here has a space within it. Hence, it is pretty obvious that spaces aren't allowed in variable names. In fact, there are a lot of other things that are not allowed in variable names. The things that are allowed are:\n\nCharacters A to Z and their lower-case counterparts a to z.\nNumbers 0 to 9. However, numbers should not come at the beginning of a variable's name.\nAnd finally, special characters that include only $ (dollar sign) and _ (underscore).\nAny valid variable names might be correct but they are not always what you should be naming your variables for a few reasons as listed below:\n\nThe name of the variable should reflect the value within them.\nThe identifier should be named following the naming guidelines or conventions for doing so. We will explain that in a bit.\nThe identifier shouldn't be a nonsense name like lname, you should always name it properly: lastName is the best way of naming a variable.", "heading": "Identifiers"}
