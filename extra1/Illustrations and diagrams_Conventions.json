{"content": "\nThis book uses various illustrations and diagrams to convey its message, e.g., flow-chart or UML diagrams, etc. Due to the nature of diagrams, they need to be designed in a scalable vector format. It is highly recommended that you use the SVG format for your diagrams. Please, do not use JPG or PNG for diagrams that could otherwise be done in SVG. Ask a regular contributor for his/her help in this matter.\n\nA regular feature for diagrams used in this book is the overall color scheme. The most notable color used for illustrations in this book is \u00a0 #2a7fff (as is shown for the diagrams below, for instance). In order to include illustrations into your content, you need to use the {{Java/Illustration}} template.
