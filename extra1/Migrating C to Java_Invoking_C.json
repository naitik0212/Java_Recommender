In general, automated translator tools fall into one of two distinct kinds:\n\nOne kind converts C code to Java byte code. It is basically a compiler that creates byte code.

This type is more complicated and uses various syntax rules to create readable Java source code. This option is best for those who want to move their C code to Java and stay in Java.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do:Add some examples.\n\n\n\n\n Java Native Interface\n\nJava ProgrammingInvoking C\n\nByte Code \n", "heading": "Migrating C to Java"}
