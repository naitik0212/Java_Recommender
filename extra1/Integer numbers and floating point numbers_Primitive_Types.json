{"content": "\nThe data types that one can use for integer numbers are byte, short, int and long but when it comes to floating point numbers, we use float or double. Now that we know that, we can modify the code in the code section 3.53 as:\n\n\n\n\n\nCode section 3.56: Correct floating point declaration and assignment.\n1 double age = 10.5;\n\n\nWhy not float, you say? If we'd used a float, we would have to append the number with a f as a suffix, so 10.5 should be 10.5f as in:\n\n\n\n\n\nCode section 3.57: The correct way to define floating point numbers of type float.\n1 float age = 10.5f;\n\n\nFloating-point math never throws exceptions. Dividing a non-zero value by 0 equals infinity. Dividing a non-infinite value by infinity equals 0.\n", "heading": "Integer numbers and floating point numbers"}
